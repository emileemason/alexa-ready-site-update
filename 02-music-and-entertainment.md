### Music
Alexa lets you listen to music from services like Amazon Music, Pandora, TuneIn, iHeartRadio, and Spotify Premium. If you’re an Amazon Prime member, you already have access to over 2 million songs on Alexa with Prime Music—and you can ask for music by genre, mood, or era. With multi-room music support you can play music across multiple Echo devices simultaneously (Bluetooth not supported for multi-room music). Learn more. For Amazon Music Unlimited Family Plan subscribers, set up your voice profile and Alexa can personalize music based on each family member’s voice and music tastes.
