### Music
Did you know that Alexa lets you listen to music from a variety of services? You can listen to tunes from Amazon Music, Spotify Premium, iHeartRadio, TuneIn, and Pandora. Amazon Prime members have access to over 2 million songs with Prime Music. Prime members can also request music by genre, mood, or even era. Also, if you have multiple Echo devices, you can play music in several different rooms. Finally, if you subscribe to the Amazon Music Unlimited Family Plan, you can set up voice profile. This will allow Alexa to personalize music based on each family member’s individual preferences.
