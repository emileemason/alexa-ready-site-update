### Calling and Messaging with the help of Alexa.
You can call or message anyone for free with your Echo device. Aleca can quickly place a call to dad when you need his assistance with handiwork around the house or send a quick voice message to your sister to check in. With Drop In, you can instantly connect to another Echo device in your home or to your friends and family. 

How to get started:
1. Download the Alexa App
    - (iOS 9.0 or higher, Android 5.0 or higher)
    - [iOS 9.0 Link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amazon-echo/id944011620)
    - [Android Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.dee.app)
2. Verify your mobile number and import all of your contacts.
3. Tell your friends and family!


### Hands-free calling
It is super simple to make calls with Alexa. After you have synced all of your contacts into your Alexa app, you can just tell Alexa to make a call. Next, set up your voice profile so that Alexa can recognize your voice. 

When someone tries to call your Echo, it will light up green. If it is your mom or someone you want to answer, you can tell Alexa to answer the call. If it is your boss or someone you want to ignore, you can just tell her to ignore it. But if your boss is calling, you should probably answer the phone.

- "Alexa, call Johnny’s mobile."
- "Alexa, dial 867-5039."


### Drop In
Drop in allows you to connect instantly with your friends and family or other Echo devices in your home. This feature does not require you to approve the Drop In so make sure you set up Drop In with only your closest friends and family.  You can learn more about this Alexa feature.

### Messaging Made Simple
Another fun feature of Alexa is the ability to send and receive messages. You can ask Alexa to send a message for you and she’ll send it, or you can set up a voice profile, and Alexa can play and send your personalized message. 

When you have a new message, you will hear a chime, and a yellow light ring will appear on your Echo device. The Alexa App will also notify you of new messages so you can quickly access them wherever they are.

#### What number will the person I am calling see? 
If you link your phone number in your Alexa App, this is the number that will appear to the people you are calling. However, if you don’t want them to see your registered phone number, you can opt-out of using this number. Then when you call someone, it will appear as “unknown.”

With Echo Connect, calls made from your home phone using your Echo device will use your home phone number.

#### What if my friend and I have different Echo devices, can we still call and message each other?
Of course! You can call and message anyone with an Echo device, no matter what type it is. 

#### What if my friend doesn’t have an Echo, can I still call them from my Echo device? 
Yes. You can call anyone once you have set up calling on Alexa. However, if you want to message someone with Alexa, then your friend would need to download the Amazon Alexa app. This app is available on iOS and Android.

#### When should I use the Drop In feature instead of just calling my friend or family member?
Most of the time, we would recommend just calling people. Drop In is specifically set up to instantly connect you to other Echo devices in your home or your closest family and friends. You won’t want to enable Drop In for most contacts. This would allow them to be able to connect instantly to your Echo without asking for your approval. 

#### Can I select who can Drop In on me? 
Yes. You choose who can Drop In on you. You can also select which devices are available for Drop In. This will allow certain Echos in your home to be available for Drop In while others will not. 

#### How much does Alexa calling and messaging cost?
Nope, it’s completely free.
