### Introducing Alexa calling and messaging. 
Now you can use your Echo device to call or message anyone—for free. When you're busy making dinner, just ask Alexa to place a call to Mom or send a quick voice message to a friend. You can also enable Drop In for when you want to instantly connect with other Echo devices in your home, or your closest family and friends.

Getting started is easy:
1. Download the updated Alexa App
    - (iOS 9.0 or higher, Android 5.0 or higher)
    - [iOS 9.0 Link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amazon-echo/id944011620)
    - [Android Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.dee.app)
2. Complete set-up by verifying your mobile number and importing contacts
3. Tell your friends


### Hands-free calling
Making calls with Alexa is easy. Once you’ve synced your contacts in the Alexa App, just ask Alexa to place a call. Set up your voice profile to teach Alexa to recognize your voice. Since Alexa recognizes your voice, when you say, “Alexa, call Mom”, Alexa will call your mom.

If someone is calling, Alexa will let you know and a green light ring will appear on your supported Echo device. You can ask Alexa to answer or ignore the call.

With Echo Show, you’ll also be able to make video calls or use Drop In, a new feature for the special cases when you want to connect instantly with your closest family and friends.

- "Alexa, call dad's mobile."
- "Alexa, dial 206-555-0126."

### Drop In
Drop In is a new feature for the special cases when you want to connect instantly with your closest family and friends or other Echo devices in your home. For example, you can drop in to ask what time dinner will be ready, see the baby’s nursery, or check in with a close relative. Learn more about setting up Drop In.

- "Alexa, drop in on the kitchen."
- "Alexa, drop in on the nuresery."
- "Alexa, drop in on the living room."

### Messaging made easy
In addition to calling, you can use Alexa to easily send and receive messages. Just ask to send a message, then tell Alexa what you’d like to say and she’ll send it. If you’ve set up a voice profile, Alexa can play and send your personalized messages from your contacts. Just say, “play my messages” or “send a message.”

You’ll hear a chime when you have a new message, and a yellow light ring will appear on your device. You’ll also be notified in the Alexa App so you can stay in touch wherever you are.

### Frequently asked questions
#### Who can I call and message?
With Alexa calling and messaging, you can call most phone numbers in the US, Mexico, and Canada, either by saying your contact's name ("Call Dad") or voice-dialing a number ("Call 222-555-0126")—emergency services such as 911 are not supported. You can also call or send messages to anyone who has a supported Echo device or the Alexa App on their phone. Learn more.

#### What number will they see?
If you have registered your cell phone number in the Alexa App, your contacts will see that number on their caller ID so they know it is you. If you want to opt-out of using your number, you can do so in the Alexa App and will appear as “unknown” to the call recipient.

With Echo Connect, calls made from your home phone using your Echo device will use your home phone number.

#### What if I have an Echo and my dad has an Echo Dot—can we still call or message each other?
Yes!

#### What if my friends don’t have an Echo, can I still call or message them from mine?
Yes! You can call their phone number once you have set up calling on Alexa. If you want to message them with Alexa, those friends would simply need to download the free Amazon Alexa App on their phone, available on iOS and Android, and enable Alexa calling and messaging.

#### When would I use Drop In instead of calling?
In the vast majority of cases you’ll use calling. Drop In is for when you want to instantly connect to another Echo in your home or your closest family and friends.

#### Can I specify who gets to Drop In on me?
Yes – you choose who, if anyone, can drop in on you. You also choose which devices are available for Drop In – for example, you might turn on Drop In for the Echo Show in the kitchen, but not for the Echo Dot in the living room.

#### How much does Alexa calling and messaging cost?
It’s free.
