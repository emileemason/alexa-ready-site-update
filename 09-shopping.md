- "Alexa, what are your deals?"

### Add to cart & track packages
Not ready to buy just yet? Ask Alexa to put an item in your shopping cart, and you’ll see it the next time you visit Amazon.com or your mobile shopping app. Alexa can also tell you when your next package from Amazon.com is due to arrive—even if you didn’t order the items with Alexa. Just ask:
- "Alexa, add hot chocolate to my cart."
- "Alexa, where's my stuff?"

### Shopping List
Every Alexa account comes with a Shopping List. Use your voice to add items, then access your list in your Alexa App when you’re at the store. Learn more or just ask:
