- "Alexa, what are your deals?"

### Add to cart & track packages
Not quite ready to make a purchase? Alexa can add an item to your shopping cart. Don’t worry. It will be there the next time you visit Amazon.com or your mobile Amazon shopping app. Do you want to know when your package is scheduled to arrive? You can ask Alexa. She’ll tell you even if you didn’t order the items from Alexa. Ask: 
- “Alexa, add tennis balls to my cart.”
- “Alexa, where’s my stuff?”


### Shopping List
Did you know every Alexa account comes with a shopping list? Just tell Alexa to add items. Then you can access this list later when you’re at the store or on your app. You can learn more below, or ask Alexa:
