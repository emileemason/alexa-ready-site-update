### Timers & alarms
Whether you’re cooking in the kitchen or snoozing in the bedroom, Alexa can keep an eye on the clock. Just ask:
- "Alexa, set a timer for 15 minutes."
- "Alexa, set an alarm for 10 a.m."
- "Alexa, how much time is left on my timer?"
- "Alexa, set a repeating alarm for Mondays at 8 a.m."
- "Alexa, set a sleep timer for 30 minutes."
- "Alexa, snooze."

### Shopping & To-do Lists
Every Alexa account comes with Shopping and To-do Lists. Use your voice to add items, then access those lists by voice or in your Alexa App. Learn more or just ask:
