Switch on the lamp without getting out of bed, turn on the fan or space heater while reading in your favorite chair, or dim the lights from the couch to watch a movie—all without lifting a finger. With Echo Show, you can also see live video feeds from compatible smart cameras without opening an app on your phone.

### Getting started is easy:
1. Choose a compatible gsmart-home connected device from the Alexa Smart Home Store.
