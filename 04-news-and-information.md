### Flash Briefing
Put together a lineup of updates that matter to you most. The Flash Briefing is completely personalized to you and your voice. Catch up on the latest news from sources like CNN, Fox News, CNET, and NPR. Alexa will never repeat old news. Just ask: 
- "Alexa, what's the news?""

### Weather & Traffic
Alexa can help you get ready for what the day has in store for you. You can ask Alexa what the weather will be like throughout the day, or you can ask how long your commute will be. You will have to set your commute start and stop point for this feature to work correctly. If you have an Echo show, you can see times for alternate routes and an extended weekly forecast. Ask Alexa: 
- "Alexa, what's my commute?"
- ”Alexa, what’s the weather today?”

Go to Settings in your Alexa App to manage your Flash Briefing.
