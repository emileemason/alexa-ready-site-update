### Flash Briefing
Flash Briefing lets you put together a personalized lineup of updates from news sources like NPR, CNN, Fox News, and CNET. If you’ve set up a voice profile, Alexa recognizes your voice and can catch you up on the latest without repeating old news. Just ask:
- "Alexa, what's the news?""

### Traffic & weather
As you’re getting ready for your day, Alexa can help. Set your commute start and stop point, and Alexa can tell you how long your commute will take. Or ask Alexa how the weather’s looking. With Echo Show, you can see times for alternate routes and the extended forecast. Just ask:
- "Alexa, what's my commute?"
- "Alexa, will it rain today?"
- "Alexa, show me the weekend forecast."

To manage your Flash Briefing, go to Settings in your Alexa App and select Flash Briefing.
